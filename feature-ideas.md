# Feature Ideas

- String isolation mode: Only show notes on the selected string(s)
- Add string names next to each string for readability
- Configurable diagram dimensions, fret bar, and string widths
- Change tunings
- "Quiz Mode" - delay showing the note on the fretboard for a (configurable?) time period
